<h1><strong>DeckDatabaseOne</strong></h1>
Welcome to my Card Catalog Web App! This web app is a full-stack project that is aimed to catalog Yugioh cards<br>

<h1><strong>Notable features of the website</strongZ></h1>
<ul>
    <li>built in User authentication to create and login to accounts using mongodb</li>
    <li>Searchbar that uses a 3rd party api to allow for users to search for desired yugioh cards from their database</li>
    <li>A page to display owned cards belonging to each user</li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Features I am planning to include</strong></h1>
<ul>
    <li>A link to a website where you can buy the cards</li>
    <li>A page that allows users to create and view previously created decks</li>
</ul>
